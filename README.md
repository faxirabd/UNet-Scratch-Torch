# UNet-Scratch-Torch
UNet build from scratch for semantic segmentation

The UNet is build exactlt as the original paper sugested 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597
Build using powerfull Pytorch which is OOP oriented and uses pythonic code!
VOC dataset is used to test the model, but any other dataset can be used, but requires a class in the folder dataset!

## following libraries are required:
| torch |
| torchvision |
| numpy |
| pillow |
| scikit-learn |
| tqdm |

###Some prediction from the VOC dataset:
