# UNet-Scratch-Torch
UNet build from scratch for semantic segmentation

The UNet is build exactlt as the original paper sugested 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597
Build using powerfull Pytorch which is OOP oriented and uses pythonic code!
VOC dataset is used to test the model, but any other dataset can be used, but requires a class in the folder dataset!

## following libraries are required:
1. torch 
2. torchvision 
3. numpy 
4. pillow 
5. scikit-learn 
6. tqdm 

### Some prediction from the VOC dataset:
